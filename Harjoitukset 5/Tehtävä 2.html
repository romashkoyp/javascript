      <h1>Chuck Norris Facts</h1>
      <div id="text">
          <p>Chuck Norris facts are satirical factoids about martial
            artist and actor Chuck Norris that have become an Internet
            phenomenon and as a result have become widespread in popular
            culture. The 'facts' are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about
            Norris' toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chuck Norris facts have spread around the world, leading
            not only to translated versions, but also spawning localized
            versions mentioning country-specific advertisements and other
            Internet phenomena. Allusions are also sometimes made to his
            use of roundhouse kicks to perform seemingly any task, his
            large amount of body hair with specific regard to his beard,
            and his role in the action television series Walker, Texas Ranger.
